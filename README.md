# CubicProjection

This is a matlab project that uses the java command line tool for creating cubic projections, available here http://os.ivrpa.org/panosalado/downloads

It takes an equirectangular image, splits it into the 6 sides of a cubic projection using the above java tool, and then joins the sides together into a combined image.
